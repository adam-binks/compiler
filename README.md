# Oreo compiler
A compiler for the toy language Oreo, written from the ground up in Python

Process and features:

* I transformed the context free grammar (CFG) to be LL(1) and added some additional language features, such as functions
* Lexing
* Syntax analysis
* Semantic analysis
* Typechecking
* Intermediate code generation (using Three Address Code)
* Machine code generation (using High Level Assembly)

Written for my Programming Language Implementation module.
